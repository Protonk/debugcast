# Other debuggers

## R's built-in debugger is actually pretty useful
## But some other options have been created to offer
## more functionality

# Packages:

## Debug
## http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/debug/index.html
 
## Requires tcl/tk (you probably have it)
## interactive debugger with more flow control
## and more consistent behavior


# IDE's:

## ESS debugger http://ess.r-project.org/
## If you like emacs, go nuts!

## RStudio
## Not too much added. fix() is called if you click on
## objects/functions in the workspace
## It doesn't look like broader support is coming soon...

## Revolution Analytics

## I haven't used it. I hear it's got cool stuff.
