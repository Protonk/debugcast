# Overview of interactive debugging in R

Key points:

* This is not an R package! Just a convenient place to plop all these files (vs. a multi-file gist)
* Not covering `try()` etc. or exception handling in application logic. Thankfully R isn't all that different from other languages in this regard.
* May be turned into a slide deck at some point
